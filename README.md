# Any script not working? Contact me: tribalwars@iwantwin.nl
All scripts here were approved by the Tribalwars.nl script-moderator team at the time they were published. Usage is on your own risk, but usually you should be fine because I intend to never publish anything illegal.

Every script has it's own folder, with both a readme and a script file. The script file is used internally, the readme tells you how to install and use the scripts, accompanied with a forum thread about the script.
